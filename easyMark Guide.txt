MAKING LISTS

Make a numbered list:
Caution: Respect spaces in between "~" and the list elements themselves.
~start-list
~ Item 1
~ Item 2
~ Item 3
~end-list

Make a nested numbered list:
~start-list
~ Item 1
~start-list
~ Sub-Item 1
~ Sub-Item 2
~end list
~ Item 2
~ Item 3
~end-list
Note: This nested structure can be expanded to any number of nested lists, as long as more nesting.

Make a bulleted list:
~start-bullets
~ Item
~ Item
~end-bullets
Note: The same nested structure can be used as above for the numbered list.

Make a custom list:
~start-custom-list
~ [Name 1] Item 1
~ [Name 2] Item 2
~end-custom-list
Note: The same nested structure can be used as above for the numbered list.
