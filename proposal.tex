LaTeX Typesetting Engine

First and foremost, the project consists of a web portal that provides easy-to-use dropdown menus and text entry matrixes for the creation of LaTeX code. The server-side Python program will later take the necessary user elements provided by the query page and generate professional LaTeX code that may be returned to the user as raw .tex code. Additionally, the user may also set an option for his or her paper to be automatically typesetted using LaTeX, with the server returning a finished PDF file.
