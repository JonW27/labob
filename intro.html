                If you want to create a scientific or mathematical paper you often have two options:
                <ol>
                    <li>Use Microsoft Word or a similar word processor, but experience a sharp decrease in quality of the paper</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Learn LaTeX or another similar language like MathML which means a much higher learning curve, but much higher quality.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                We decided to create LaTeX 'Labob', a program to bridge this curve, that would be free to everyone, easy to use, yet still maintain high quality glyphs and typography. Labob means that anyone can create a paper that uses Computer Modern Roman (I went out of my way to download it from Sourceforge to maintain authenticity) and write a high quality math or scientific paper. LaTeX is no longer limited to those who have to wrangle with it, but to HS students or teachers like you who may not have the free time to learn it or understand it. Even yet, we still support built-in LaTeX comprehension so that if you do know it by chance, you can do more advanced things with it.

                No login, no registration, no research analytics or focus groups. Ease of access is important and with a couple of lines, you can have a professional looking paper.

                This entirely deviated from the main point, to explain LaTeX, and for that I have a link <a href="https://is.gd/UBxP6t">here</a> for you.
