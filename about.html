                Our project 'labob' got its name because we were discussing Microsoft Bob (the OS) while we were discussing our final project. On the spur of the moment while talking about LaTeX and Microsoft Bob we decided to name our creation <i>labob</i>. Since our project needed to be query based and we wanted to make something useful over something that provides some moments of entertainment and engagement we went with a LaTeX research paper generator that would generate the LaTeX code, the PDF, and a webpage for it, hosted on marge. Since we were a duo project we needed a way in order to collaborate and host our project code and provide versioning in case something went wrong. We used git, almost picking gitlab as the host, but staying with github and chose the license for the project to be the GNU public license as it is copyleft and allows for more free forking and encourages making the project better.
